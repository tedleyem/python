# PYTHON DOJO
This repo is for training purposes.
It consists of python scripts, tools, and utilities that
were created for testing in my free time or strengthening my skills with python.

My goal is to add a readme under each folder to explain what was being done
and why to showcase my skills and/or help others with ways to solve problems
