# PYTHON PLAYGROUND 

This is a repo of python scripts/tools 
that I created to mess around with and keep my understanding of python 
strong. Hope some people find some of these useful. 

# 10 week challenge
The goal of this project is to write 10 python scripts/tools in 10 weeks. 
One project per week to keep my skills sharp with python.
