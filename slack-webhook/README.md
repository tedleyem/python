# STATES INFO 

I wanted to send the content of a file 
as a slack message. The slack api has options that 
would allow me to send the file but I didnt want to fill 
a slack channel with attachments. 

This script takes an example of json data 
and reads the file, sets it as a variable, and sends it 
usoing a slack webhook.
