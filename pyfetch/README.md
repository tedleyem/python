# pyFetch - A command-line system information tool written in python

The inspiration in this project was to recreate [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) in python and distribute using [pypi](https://pypi.org/).

Just like Neofetch, pyFetch displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in an aesthetic and visually pleasing way.
